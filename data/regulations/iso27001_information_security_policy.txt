Information security policies provide management direction and support for information security
in accordance with business requirements and relevant laws and regulations.

Organizations should establish a set of information security policies that are approved by
management, published, communicated to employees and relevant external parties, and regularly
reviewed for continued suitability.

The absence of a formally approved information security policy may result in inconsistent
security practices, lack of accountability, and increased exposure to operational and legal risks.

Security policies should clearly define objectives, responsibilities, and enforcement mechanisms.
They should also be aligned with the organization's risk management strategy and business goals.

Regular reviews should be conducted to ensure that policies remain effective and relevant in
response to organizational changes, evolving threats, and regulatory updates.
