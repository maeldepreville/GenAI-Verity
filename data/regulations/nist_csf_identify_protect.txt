The Identify function assists in developing an organizational understanding to manage
cybersecurity risk to systems, people, assets, data, and capabilities.

This includes asset management, governance, risk assessment, and supply chain risk management.

The Protect function outlines safeguards to ensure delivery of critical services. This includes
access control, awareness and training, data security, maintenance, and protective technology.

Organizations that lack proper identification and protection mechanisms may struggle to detect
and respond effectively to cybersecurity incidents.
