Taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation, and the nature, scope,
context, and purposes of processing, organizations must implement appropriate technical and
organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk.

Such measures may include encryption, confidentiality controls, integrity mechanisms,
availability safeguards, and the ability to restore data in a timely manner following an
incident.

Failure to implement adequate security measures can expose personal data to unauthorized
access, loss, or alteration, potentially resulting in regulatory sanctions and reputational damage.
