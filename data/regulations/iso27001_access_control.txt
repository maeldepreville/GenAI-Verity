Access control ensures that access to information and information processing facilities
is restricted according to business and security requirements.

Organizations should define and implement access control policies based on the principles
of least privilege and need-to-know. User access rights must be formally authorized,
periodically reviewed, and revoked when no longer required.

Weak access control mechanisms can lead to unauthorized access, data leakage, and
privilege escalation. Particular attention should be given to privileged accounts
and remote access mechanisms.

Authentication mechanisms should be robust, and access rights should reflect job roles
and responsibilities. Logging and monitoring of access events is recommended.
