Personal data must be processed lawfully, fairly, and in a transparent manner in relation
to the data subject. Data should be collected for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes
and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes.

Organizations must ensure that personal data is adequate, relevant, and limited to what
is necessary in relation to the purposes for which it is processed. This principle is often
referred to as data minimization.

Personal data must be accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date. Data that is inaccurate
should be erased or rectified without delay.

Storage limitation requires that personal data be kept in a form which permits identification
of data subjects for no longer than necessary.

Organizations are responsible for demonstrating compliance with these principles.
